## CSS

### CSS typed arithmetic

Typed arithmetic lets you write expressions in CSS such as `calc(10em / 1px)` or
`calc(20% / 0.5em * 1px)`. This is useful in, for example, typography, as it
lets you convert a typed value into an untyped one and reuse it for number
accepting properties. Another use case is to multiply the unitless value by
another type. For example, you can now cast from pixels to degrees.

### CSS `caret-animation` property

Chromium supports animation of the `caret-color` property. However, when
animated, the caret's default blinking behavior interferes with the animation.

The CSS `caret-animation` property has two possible values: `auto` and `manual`.
`auto` means browser default (blinking), and `manual` means the developer
controls the caret animation. Additionally, users who are disturbed by or have
adverse reactions to blinking or flashing visuals can disable the blinking with
a user stylesheet.

### highlightsFromPoint API

The `highlightsFromPoint` API lets developers interact with custom highlights.
It detects which highlights exist at a specific point within a document. This
interactivity is valuable for complex web features where multiple highlights may
overlap or exist within shadow DOM. By providing precise point-based highlight
detection, the API empowers developers to manage dynamic interactions with
custom highlights more effectively. For example, developers can respond to user
clicks or hover events on highlighted regions to trigger custom tooltips,
context menus, or other interactive features.

### `ScrollIntoView` container option

The `ScrollIntoViewOptions` container option allows developers to perform a
`scrollIntoView` operation that only scrolls the nearest ancestor scroll
container. For example, the following snippet only scrolls the scroll container
of `target` to bring `target` into view, but won't scroll all of the scroll
containers to the viewport:

```text
target.scrollIntoView({container: 'nearest'});
```

### View transitions: Inherit more animation properties

Adds more animation properties to inherit through the view transition pseudo
tree:

- `animation-timing-function`
- `animation-iteration-count`
- `animation-direction`
- `animation-play-state`

### Nested view transitions groups

This feature allows view transitions to generate a nested pseudo-element tree
rather than a flat one. This allows the view transition to appear more in line
with its original elements and visual intent. It enables clipping, nested 3D
transforms, and proper application of effects like opacity, masking, and
filters.

### Propagate viewport `overscroll-behavior` from root

This change propagates `overscroll-behavior` from the root instead of the body.

The CSS working group resolved not to propagate properties from the `<body>` to
the viewport. Instead, properties of the viewport propagate from the root
(`<html>`) element. As such, `overscroll-behavior` should propagate from the
root element. However, Chrome has had a longstanding issue: it propagates
`overscroll-behavior` from the `<body>` rather than the root. This behavior is
not interoperable with other browsers. This change makes Chrome comply with the
specification and become interoperable with other implementations.

### CSS `counter()` and `counters()` in alt text of `content` property

This feature adds the ability to use `counter()` and `counters()` in the alt
text of the `content` property. This provides more meaningful information to
improve accessibility.

### CSS `scroll-target-group` property

The `scroll-target-group` property specifies whether the element is a scroll
marker group container. It accepts one of the following values:

- 'none': The element does not establish a scroll marker group container.
- 'auto': The element establishes a scroll marker group container forming a
  scroll marker group containing all of the scroll marker elements for which
  this is the nearest ancestor scroll marker group container.

Establishing a scroll marker group container lets any anchor HTML elements with
a fragment identifier that are inside such a container to be the HTML equivalent
of `::scroll-marker` pseudo-elements. The anchor element whose scroll target is
currently in view can be styled using the `:target-current` pseudo-class.

### Support `font-variation-settings` descriptor in `@font-face` rule

CSS allows developers to adjust a font's weight, width, slant, and other axes
using the `font-variation-settings` property on individual elements. However,
Chromium-based browsers lack support for this property within `@font-face`
declarations. This feature supports the string-based syntax for
`font-variation-settings` as defined in CSS Fonts Level 4. Invalid or
unrecognized feature tags are ignored per specification. No binary or
non-standard forms are supported. Variable fonts are becoming more widely
adopted for both performance and typographic flexibility. Adding support for
this descriptor in Chromium enhances control, reduces repetition, and supports a
more scalable, modern approach to web typography.

## DOM

### `ToggleEvent` source attribute

The `source` attribute of a `ToggleEvent` contains the element that triggered
the `ToggleEvent` to be fired, if applicable. For example, if a user clicks a
`<button>` element with the `popovertarget` or `commandfor` attribute set to
open a popover, the `ToggleEvent` fired on the popover will have its source
attribute set to the invoking `<button>`.

## Isolated Web Apps (IWAs)

### Controlled Frame API (available only to IWAs)

This feature adds a Controlled Frame API available only to Isolated Web Apps
(IWAs). Like similarly-named APIs on other platforms, Controlled Frame allows
embedding all content, even third-party content that cannot be embedded in
`<iframe>`. Controlled Frame also allows controlling embedded content with a
collection of API methods and events. For more information about Isolated Web
Apps, see the [Isolated Web Apps
explainer](https://github.com/WICG/isolated-web-apps/blob/main/README.md).

## JavaScript

### `Uint8Array` to and from base64 and hex

Base64 is a common way to represent arbitrary binary data as ASCII. JavaScript
has `Uint8Arrays` for binary data. However, it lacks a built-in mechanism to
encode that data as base64, or to take base64 data and produce a corresponding
`Uint8Array`. This feature adds the ability and methods for converting between
hex strings and `Uint8Arrays`.

### View transition finished promise timing change

The current finished promise timing happens within the rendering lifecycle
steps. This means that code that runs as a result of promise resolution happens
after the visual frame that removes the view transition has been produced. This
can cause a flicker at the end of the animation if the script moves styles to
preserve a visually similar state. This change resolves the issue by moving the
view transition cleanup steps to run asynchronously after the lifecycle is
completed.

## Web APIs

### `ReadableStreamBYOBReader` `min` option

This feature introduces a `min` option to the existing
`ReadableStreamBYOBReader.read(view)` method. The method already accepts an
`ArrayBufferView` into which it reads data, but currently does not guarantee how
many elements are written before the read resolves. By specifying a `min` value,
you can require that the stream wait until at least that many elements are
available before resolving the read. This improves upon the current behavior,
where reads may resolve with fewer elements than the view can hold.

### Get Installed Related Apps API on desktop

The Get Installed Related Apps API (navigator.getInstalledRelatedApps) provides
sites access to if their corresponding related applications are installed.
Sites are only allowed to use this API if the application has an established association with the web origin.

The API was launched in Chrome 80 for Android.
Additional support for web apps on Desktop was enabled in Chrome 140.

### Http cookie prefix

In some cases, it's important to distinguish on the server side between cookies
set by the server and those set by the client. One such case involves cookies
normally always set by the server. However, unexpected code (such as an XSS
exploit, a malicious extension, or a commit from a confused developer) might set
them on the client. This proposal adds a signal that lets servers make such a
distinction. More specifically, it defines the `__Http` and `__HostHttp`
prefixes, which ensure a cookie is not set on the client side using script.

## Service worker

### `SharedWorker` script inherits controller for blob script URL

The specification states that workers should inherit controllers for the blob
URL. However, existing code allows only dedicated workers to inherit the
controller; shared workers don't. This fixes Chrome's behavior to align with the
specification. The `SharedWorkerBlobURLFixEnabled` enterprise policy controls
this feature.

### Add `ServiceWorkerStaticRouterTimingInfo`

This feature adds timing information for the ServiceWorker Static routing API,
exposed in the navigation timing API and resource timing API for developer use.
ServiceWorker provides timing information to mark certain points in time.

This feature adds two pieces of Static routing API-relevant timing information:

- `RouterEvaluationStart`: Time to start matching a request with registered
  router rules.
- `CacheLookupStart`: Time to start looking up the cache storage if the source
  is `"cache"`.

Additionally, this feature adds two pieces of router source information: the
matched router source and the final router source.

## Origin trials

### Enable incoming call notifications

This feature extends the Notifications API to allow installed PWAs to send
incoming call notifications—notifications with call-styled buttons and a
ringtone. This extension helps VoIP web apps create more engaging experiences by
making it easier for users to recognize and answer calling notifications.
Additionally, this feature helps bridge the gap between native and web
implementations of apps that have them both.

### Crash Reporting key-value API

This feature introduces a new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`,
backed by a per-document map that holds data appended to crash reports.

The data placed in this API's backing map is sent in the `CrashReportBody` if
any renderer process crashes occur on the site. This lets developers debug what
specific state in their application might be causing a given crash.

### Add the `clipboardchange` event

The `clipboardchange` event fires whenever a web app or any other system
application changes the system clipboard contents. This allows web apps like
remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards synchronized with the system
clipboard. It provides an efficient alternative to polling the clipboard with
JavaScript for changes.

### Enable `SharedWorker` on Android

The long-standing demand for SharedWorker support on Android stems from several
needs expressed by web developers:

- **Resource sharing and efficiency**: Developers aim to share a single
  WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection across multiple tabs,
  thereby conserving resources.
- **Persistent resource management**: A requirement to share and persist
  resources across tabs, particularly for technologies like WASM-based SQLite.
- **Closing a feature gap**: Other major mobile browsers, including Safari on
  iOS and Firefox on Android, already support SharedWorker, making Chrome on
  Android the last major browser to address this gap.

## Removals

### Stop sending `Purpose: prefetch` header from prefetches and prerenders

Prefetches and prerenders now use the `Sec-Purpose` header, therefore the legacy
`Purpose: prefetch` header is being removed.

This will be scoped to speculation rules `prefetch`, speculation rules
`prerender`, `<link rel=prefetch>`, and Chromium's non-standard `<link
rel=prerender>`.

### Deprecate special font size rules for H1 within some elements

rules](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#sections-and-headings)
for `<h1>` tags nested within `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, or `<section>`
tags:

These special rules are deprecated, because they cause accessibility issues.
Namely, they visually reduce the font size for nested `<h1>` elements so that
they "look" like `<h2>` elements, but nothing in the accessibility tree reflects
this demotion.
