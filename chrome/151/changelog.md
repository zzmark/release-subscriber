## CSS and UI

### Animation accessor on animation and transition events

Adds a read-only `animation` attribute to the `AnimationEvent` and `TransitionEvent` interfaces. This attribute returns the associated `Animation` object that triggered the event.

[Spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-2/#interface-animationevent)

### CSS `ruby-overhang` property

Adds support for the `ruby-overhang` CSS property. The property accepts `auto`, `spaces`, or `none` keywords to control the overhang of ruby annotation text. Per the CSS Working Group specification, `none` is aliased to `spaces`, which lets text overhang only over whitespace and CJK punctuation. This prevents unnecessary layout gaps while preserving text readability.

### Change the `position-anchor` initial value to `normal`

Changes the initial value of the `position-anchor` CSS property from `none` to `normal` to align with the specification and other browsers. The `normal` value behaves like `none` if the `position-area` CSS property is `none`, and otherwise behaves as `auto`.

[Spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-anchor-position-1/#position-anchor)

### No auto-rewind for `AnimationTrigger` play methods

When an animation associated with an `AnimationTrigger` has already run to completion, invoking the `play`, `play-forwards`, or `play-backwards` trigger actions will no longer cause the animation to restart or auto-rewind.

## DOM and HTML

### Declarative shadow DOM: `shadowrootslotassignment` attribute

Adds the `shadowrootslotassignment` attribute to the `<template>` element, which lets declarative shadow roots use manual slot assignment. Previously, this option was only available imperatively by using `attachShadow({slotAssignment: "manual"})`. The attribute accepts `named` (the default, preserving existing behavior) and `manual`, and is reflected by the `shadowRootSlotAssignment` property on `HTMLTemplateElement`.

### XML parsing in Rust for non-XSLT scenarios

To improve browser security and protect against memory-related vulnerabilities, Chrome is updating its XML parsing engine to a memory-safe Rust implementation for common scenarios where XSLT is not required. This update eliminates potential memory corruption bugs while maintaining full compatibility with web specifications. The new parser handles `DOMParser`, `XMLHttpRequest.responseXML`, standalone SVG image documents, and external SVG image resources.

## Performance and networking

### Cross-origin redirect timing opt-in

Enables servers to opt in to having their cross-origin redirects measured by the destination origin of a navigation. This lets developers measure and optimize redirect latency for navigations under their control.

|
[Spec](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1931)

### Navigation: Ignore duplicate navigations

Prevents an ongoing navigation from being unnecessarily canceled by a new, identical navigation initiated in rapid succession. This optimization improves performance and user experience by avoiding wasted network resources on duplicate requests caused by accidental double-clicks.

### `PerformanceSoftNavigation` and `InteractionContentfulPaint` performance entries

Adds `soft-navigation` and `interaction-contentful-paint` entry types to the performance timeline to track interaction-driven performance in single-page applications (SPAs). The `interaction-contentful-paint` entry reports on new contentful paints within parts of the page modified by a user interaction, helping developers understand interaction loading latency even across asynchronous fetch requests. The `soft-navigation` entry reports same-document history state changes initiated by interactions, establishing a new time origin to attribute subsequent performance data to the active route rather than the initial document URL.

### Permission policy merger: `direct-sockets-private` with `local-network` and `loopback-network`

Replaces the existing `direct-sockets-private` permission policy with more granular `local-network` and `loopback-network` permission policies. Isolated Web App manifests now require these specific policies to enable Direct Sockets connections to local or loopback network addresses, providing developers with more precise control over network access and making network requirements transparent in the manifest.

[Spec](https://wicg.github.io/direct-sockets/#permissions-policy-pna)

### Speculation rules: `form_submission` field

Extends speculation rules syntax to let developers specify the `form_submission` field for prerendering. This directs the browser to prepare the prerender as a form submission so that it can be activated by real form submission navigations, such as search forms resulting in a GET request navigation.

### `textStream()` for `Response`, `Request`, and `Blob`

Adds a `textStream()` method to interfaces that represent a byte stream (`Request`, `Response`, and `Blob`). This provides a convenient shorthand equivalent to piping the byte stream through a `TextDecoderStream()`.

## Media, Sensors, and Input

### Capability element: `<usermedia>` MVP

Introduces the declarative `<usermedia>` capability element, a browser-controlled control for starting and interacting with media streams. By embedding a browser-controlled element in the page, a user click provides a clear, intentional signal before triggering permission prompts. This improves the prompt user experience and provides a straightforward recovery path for users who have previously denied the permission.

### `DeviceOrientation` events permission request API

Lets web developers call `DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission()` and `DeviceMotionEvent.requestPermission()` to ask the user agent for device orientation and motion data to be shared with the page. These static methods return a promise that resolves to either `granted` or `denied` based on whether the user has allowed sensor data sharing.

### Wheel event momentum

Exposes a `momentum` boolean attribute on wheel events to identify events generated by native platform scrolling inertia. After a user lifts their finger from a trackpad following a fling interaction, native platforms continue firing wheel events to simulate inertia. The `momentum` attribute differentiates these simulated events from physical trackpad interactions, letting developers ignore fling events or customize rich fling effects.

## Accessibility and Web Speech

### `aria-actions` attribute

Adds support for the `aria-actions` attribute. For UI patterns where secondary actions are placed within composite interactive widgets, the `aria-actions` attribute lets developers expose these secondary action buttons directly to assistive technologies for improved discoverability.

### Web Speech API: Unspoken punctuation

Adds the `unspokenPunctuation` boolean attribute to the `SpeechRecognition` interface of the Web Speech API. When enabled (`true`), this attribute directs the speech recognition engine to automatically infer and insert punctuation marks (such as periods, commas, and question marks) based on natural pauses, grammatical structure, and prosody, without requiring explicit spoken punctuation commands.

## Artificial Intelligence

### `LanguageDetector` support for Traditional vs. Simplified Chinese

Adds two new detectable language codes, `zh-Hant` (Traditional Chinese) and `zh-Hans` (Simplified Chinese), to the Language Detector API. Detection results that previously returned `zh` will now return one of these more specific values.

## Origin trials

### Algorithm updates in WebCrypto

Adds post-quantum cryptography algorithms and a common symmetric AEAD algorithm to the Web Cryptography API, enabling developers to access browser-provided implementations of NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms: ML-KEM (768, 1024), ML-DSA (44, 65, 87), ChaCha20-Poly1305, and X-Wing.

### Declarative Performance Observer

Proposes a reliable, browser-resident telemetry system that reports performance metrics from navigation initiation to page termination using a declarative HTTP response header. This ensures telemetry data is captured even in scenarios where the request fails due to network errors or if the renderer process is terminated by the operating system.

### Prefetch activation beacon

Introduces the `on-prefetch-activation` HTTP response header, enabling servers to specify a telemetry endpoint that the browser notifies whenever a prefetched resource is used for a navigation. This gives developers a reliable signal to measure the precision and performance impact of their prefetch strategies.

## Deprecations and removals

### Chrome 151 removes support for macOS 12

Chrome 150 is the last release to support macOS 12. Starting with Chrome 151, macOS 13 or later is required. On Macs running macOS 12, Chrome will continue to function and display an infobar warning, but will no longer receive security or feature updates.

[ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5077742779498496)

### Remove `[LegacyNoInterfaceObject]` from `FontFaceSet` IDL

Removes `[LegacyNoInterfaceObject]` from the `FontFaceSet` IDL so that `FontFaceSet` is properly exposed as a global property on the `window` object. Because no constructor is defined in the IDL, calling `new FontFaceSet()` from JavaScript now throws a `TypeError: Illegal constructor`, matching the specification and aligning with Firefox and Safari.
