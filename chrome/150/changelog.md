## CSS and UI

### `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors

The `AccentColor` and `AccentColorText` system colors can be used in CSS to
access the system accent color specified on the user's device. This lets
developers apply native-app-like styling to their web content in contexts where
users expect OS theme integration, such as an installed web application. Users
must be in an installed web application on the initial profile to see the system
accent color rendered.

### Allow optional rounding parameter for `polygon()`

Adds an optional corner-rounding parameter in the `polygon()` CSS shape
function. Developers can specify a length value to round polygon corners without
manually computing bezier curves.

### Animatable `zoom`

The CSS `zoom` property is animatable and interpolates as a `<number>`.
Developers can transition and animate `zoom` to smoothly scale elements and
their layout, complementing existing transform-based scaling.

### CSS `url()` request modifiers

CSS `url()` functions accept optional request modifiers after the quoted URL
string: `cross-origin()`, `integrity()`, and `referrer-policy()`. These
modifiers control the fetch behavior of the referenced resource directly from
CSS, without requiring changes to HTML markup or JavaScript. For example,
`background-image: url("image.png" cross-origin(anonymous))` fetches the image
using CORS anonymous mode. This gives authors fine-grained control over
cross-origin access, subresource integrity, and referrer policy for CSS-loaded
resources including images, fonts, SVG references, and imported stylesheets.

### CSS `text-fit` property

Scales the font size of text nodes to perfectly fit the width of its containing
box.

This property lets developers ensure headlines or dynamic content fill the
available horizontal space without manual font-size calculations or complex
JavaScript workarounds. It provides a robust, CSS-native solution for responsive
typography that maintains visual alignment across different screen sizes and
varying text lengths.

### CSS `background-clip: border-area`

Implements the `border-area` value for the CSS `background-clip` property, as
defined in CSS Backgrounds Level 4. `background-clip: border-area` clips an
element's background to the area painted by its border strokes, taking
`border-width` and `border-style` into account while ignoring transparency from
`border-color`. This lets developers gradient borders without `border-image`.
WebKit already ships this feature; this implementation brings Chromium to
parity.

### CSS `image(<color>)` function

The `image()` function lets authors generate a solid-color image from any
color. Its syntax is: `image() = image( <color> )`

### CSS `light-dark()` with image values

Extends the CSS `light-dark()` function to accept image values (`url()`,
`image-set()`, `none`) in author stylesheets, letting image properties like
`background-image`, `list-style-image`, `border-image-source`, `cursor`, and
`content` automatically switch between images based on the user's preferred
color scheme. Previously this was only allowed in UA stylesheets. This aligns
with the CSS Color 5 specification and matches Firefox's existing implementation.

### Comma-separated container queries

Support multiple queries per `@container` rule. The `@container` rule applies if
at least one of the queries matches.

This makes it possible to have fallback queries for features which are not
supported in all browsers.

### Expose unprintable areas with CSS

Printers usually have a small area at each of the four edges of a sheet of paper
that they are not capable of marking reliably, usually due to the printer's
paper handling mechanism. The default page margins are expected to be bigger
than these areas, but if authors set margins on their own, and even want to add
`@page` margin boxes (for example, for custom headers and footers), they need a
way of telling where it's safe to print and not.

The CSS descriptor `page-margin-safety` can be used to steer clear of such
unprintable areas.

### `flex-wrap: balance`

`flex-wrap: balance` lets developers distribute content between flex-lines so
that it appears more balanced (similar to `text-wrap: balance`).

The `named-feature()` function lets CSS `@supports` rules query for a small set
of specific named features that are not possible to test for using other
`@supports` mechanisms but which are considered highly valuable to test for.

### `overscroll-behavior: chain`

`overscroll-behavior` now has for values: `none`, `auto`, `contain`
and the new value `chain`. These values
affect two independent effects: scroll propagation and local border effect (for
example, overscroll stretch).

- `none`: no propagation, no local effect
- `auto`: propagation, local effect
- `contain`: no propagation, local effect
- `chain`: propagation, no local effect

### Support `path-length` as a CSS property.

This change introduces a new CSS property, `path-length`, which maps to the
existing SVG `pathLength` presentation attribute. It applies to SVG geometry
elements that support `pathLength` (including `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`,
`<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, and `<ellipse>`).

## DOM and HTML

### Clone into all descendant `selectedcontent` elements

Several small changes are being made to edge cases of the `selectedcontent`
element:

- When multiple selectedcontent elements are put in a select element at the
  same time, all of them will be kept up to date instead of only the first one
  in DOM order.
- Updating the selectedcontent element is deferred when it would run during
  insertion, removal, or moving steps to fix security issues. The update is
  deferred by using post-insertion steps or microtasks.

### `Focusgroup`

Provides the ability to declaratively give composite widgets arrow key
navigation, a guaranteed tab stop, and last-focused memory, replacing hand-coded
roving `tabindex` scripts. Example:

```text
<div focusgroup="toolbar wrap" aria-label="Formatting">
  <button>Bold</button>
  <button>Italic</button>
  <button>Underline</button>
</div>

Use `<template for>` and processing instruction ranges (`<?marker>`, `<?start>`,
and `<?end>`) to update existing parts of the document without JS.

### Parse processing instructions in HTML

Processing instructions (syntax: `<?target data>`) are an existing DOM
construct, exposed in XML, that represents node objects that are not elements
but can have some semantic meaning for the processing of a document.

Processing instructions are parsed by the HTML parser, and receive an attribute
API similar to elements to mutate their data.

### `popover=hint` behavior changes

This change implements a revised and simplified stacking model for the
`popover=hint` attribute and its interactions with `popover=auto`. Previously,
the interactions between these two types of popovers could be complex in some
corner case situations (such as nesting auto popovers inside hint popovers), and
could lead to unexpected behavior. Under the new model, opening a hint popover
does not inadvertently close unrelated auto popovers. Hint popovers are only
hidden when their ancestral auto popover is hidden, or when a new, unrelated
auto popover is opened. Additionally, developers can safely nest an auto popover
inside a hint popover; instead of throwing an exception or breaking the stack,
the nested auto popover gracefully "downgrades" and behaves as a hint popover.
This supports use cases such as placing a `customizable-select` within a
`popover=hint`.

To further improve predictability and prevent complex state mutations, we are
also tightening the behavior around opening and closing popovers from within the
`beforetoggle` event. There were guards in place for some, but not all, of the
possible cases before. This change revamps the mechanism used to detect these
cases, so that it should more reliably throw `InvalidStateErrors` for all such
cases. This ensures that popover state management remains stable and prevents
looping reentrancy bugs.

### Programmatic scroll promises

This feature provides a reliable signal for the completion status of a
programmatic smooth-scroll. All scroll methods in `Element` and `Window` return
`Promise` objects that get resolved on scroll completion, and the resolved value
indicates whether the scroll was interrupted or not.

## Graphics and media

### Disable `SVG` filters on plugins and iframes

Chrome 150 will prevent `SVG` filters from being applied to embedded plugins
(for example, PDFs) and cross-origin or restricted iframes (for example,
sandboxed iframes). When a plugin or iframe would be painted with an SVG filter
effect, the effect tree is traversed to find the highest ancestor without SVG
filters, and that effect is then applied instead.

### WebGPU: Immediates

Adds a new immediate address space in WGSL and a `setImmediateData()` method on
render pass, compute pass, and render bundle encoders that lets developers pass
small amounts of frequently-updated data directly to shaders without creating
GPU buffer objects or bind groups.

## Security and Web Speech

### Opaque origin for `data:` URLs

Chrome 150 updates how dedicated and shared Workers handle [`data:`
URLs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2397). Rather than automatically
inheriting the security origin of the script or page that created them, these
workers are assigned a unique opaque origin.

This alignment with the worker [HTML
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-workers-20210128/#worker)
enhances security by isolating these workers from the creator's same-origin
state, preventing them from accessing sensitive data using mechanisms like
`BroadcastChannel` or same-origin storage. To maintain correct isolation
boundaries, these workers still reside within the same storage partition (for
example, by preserving the top-level site or nonce) as their creator.

### Web Speech API: On-Device Recognition Quality

Extends the `SpeechRecognition` interface by adding a `quality` property to
`SpeechRecognitionOptions`. This lets developers specify the semantic capability
required for on-device recognition (with `processLocally: true`).

The proposed quality enum supports three levels: `command`, `dictation`, and
`conversation`. These map to increasing task complexity and hardware requirements.
This lets developers determine if the local device can handle high-stakes use
cases (like meeting transcription) or if they should fallback to cloud services.

## Web Apps

### `PWA` origin migration

When a user installs a Progressive Web App (`PWA`), its identity and security
context are tightly bound to its web origin, for example, `app.example.com`.
This presents a significant challenge for developers who need to change their
PWA's origin due to rebranding, domain restructuring, or technical
re-architecture. Without origin migration, such a change forces users to
manually uninstall the old app and reinstall the new one, leading to a
disruptive experience and a potential increase in user loss rate. Chrome 150
introduces a mechanism for developers to seamlessly migrate an installed PWA to
a new, same-site origin, preserving user trust and permissions.

The
[WebAppInstallForceList](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#WebAppInstallForceList)
policy blocks migration. Since enterprise policies around web applications are
primarily based on URLs and origins, there is a risk that a migration would
bypass certain policies an administrator might have configured. No migration will be
offered to the user when an app is force-installed by their enterprise
administrator, and instead a banner will be shown explaining this to the user.

Expose measurement data regarding speculative loads (preloads, prefetches and
prerenders) as part of a newly exposed `performance.getSpeculations()` method.
That would enable developers to measure the efficacy of various speculative
loading strategies and adapt them accordingly.

### `WebRTC` Diagnostic Logging API

API for `WebRTC` diagnostic logging.

This API lets an application opt in to diagnostic logging. These logs contain
information about the WebRTC activity by the application and are useful for
local debugging or to file bugs.

Logs can be optionally uploaded out of band to the browser vendor and can be
used for diagnosing bugs. The application gets an ID that can be attached to a
bug report, similar to crashes.

Diagnostic logs are enabled with an enterprise policy called
`WebRtcDiagnosticLogCollectionAllowedForOrigins`.
