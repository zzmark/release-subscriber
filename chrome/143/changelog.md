## CSS and UI

### CSS anchored fallback container queries

Introduces `@container anchored(fallback)` to style descendants of anchor
positioned elements based on which of `position-try-fallbacks` is applied.

Such queries can be used to style an anchored element's tether or its
animations, based on how the anchor and the anchored element are positioned
relative to each other.

### Side-relative syntax for `background-position-x/y` longhands

Defines the background image's position relative to one of its edges.

This syntax provides a more flexible and responsive mechanism to
define the background image position, instead of using fixed values that need to
be adapted to the window or frame size.

This feature is applied also to the `-webkit-mask-position` property to ensure webcompat
levels are the same.

### Implement CSS property `font-language-override`

Introduces support for `font-language-override` CSS property.
The property allows developers to override the system language used
for OpenType glyph substitution by specifying a four-character language tag
directly in CSS.

This enables fine-grained typographic control, particularly useful for
multilingual content or fonts with language-specific glyph variants.

### Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility

Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest specification. This makes the
update process more deterministic and predictable, giving the dev more control
over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations, and
allowing removal of the *update check throttle* that user agents currently need
to implement to avoid wasting network resources.

## Device

### Gamepad `ongamepadconnected` and `ongamepaddisconnected` event handler attributes

Adds `ongamepadconnected` and `ongamepaddisconnected` event handlers to the
`WindowEventHandlers` interface mixin.

This enables support for the following event handler attributes:

- `window.ongamepadconnected`
- `document.body.ongamepadconnected`
- `window.ongamepaddisconnected`
- `document.body.ongamepaddisconnected`

## DOM

### Allow more characters in JavaScript DOM APIs

The HTML parser lets elements and attributes
have a wide variety of valid characters and names, but the JavaScript DOM
APIs to create the same elements and attributes are more strict and don't match
the parser.

This change relaxes the validation of the JavaScript DOM APIs to match the HTML
parser.

## JavaScript

### ICU 77 (supporting Unicode 16)

The Unicode support library ICU (International Components for Unicode) is
upgraded from version 74.2 to 77.1, adding support for Unicode 16 and updating
locale data. Two changes could pose some risk for web applications that assume a
specific format from the Intl JS APIs:

1. The default Italian number formatting changed to omit the thousand separator
   for 4-digit numbers. For example `new Intl.NumberFormat("it").format(1234)`
   will return 1234 instead of 1.234. The old behavior can be achieved with the
   `useGrouping` parameter for the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor.
2. In some English locales (`en-AU`, `en-GB`, and `en-IN`), a comma was added after
   full-length weekdays, for example, changing Saturday 30 April 2011 to
   Saturday, 30 April 2011. Web applications should avoid relying on the
   precise formatting of dates and they may change again in future.

### EditContext: TextFormat underlineStyle and underlineThickness

The
[EditContext API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EditContext) shipped with a bug in Chrome
where the [`TextFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/TextFormat)
object supplied by the
[textformatupdate event](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/EditContext/textformatupdate_event)
provides incorrect values for the `underlineStyle` and `underlineThickness`
properties. Before Chrome 143 the possible values are `None`, `Solid`, `Dotted`,
`Dashed`, `Squiggle` and `None`, `Thin`, `Thick`. However the specification lists `none`,
`solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, `wavy` and `none`, `thin`, `thick`.

The correct values as specified are now implemented from Chrome 143.

### `DataTransfer` property for `insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop` and `insertReplacementText` input events

Populate the `dataTransfer` property on input events with an `inputType` of
`insertFromPaste`, `insertFromDrop`, and `insertReplacementText` to provide access to
clipboard and drag-drop data during editing operations in contenteditable
elements.

The `dataTransfer` object contains the same data that was available during the
`beforeinput` event.

This feature only applies to contenteditable elements. For form controls
(textarea, input), the behavior remains unchanged—the data property contains
the inserted text and `dataTransfer` remains null.

### FedCM: Support structured JSON responses from IdPs

Allows Identity Providers (IdPs) to return structured JSON objects instead of
plain strings to Relying Parties (RPs) using the `id_assertion_endpoint`.

This change simplifies integration for developers by eliminating the need to
manually serialize and parse JSON strings. It enables more dynamic and flexible
authentication flows, allowing RPs to interpret complex responses directly and
support varied protocols like OAuth2, OIDC, or IndieAuth without out-of-band
agreements.

## Network

### WebTransport Application Protocol Negotiation

WebTransport Application Protocol Negotiation allows negotiation of the protocol
used by the web application within the WebTransport handshake.

A web application can specify a list of application protocols offered when
constructing a `WebTransport` object, which are then conveyed to the server using
HTTP headers; if the server picks one of those protocols, it can indicate that
within response headers, and that reply is available within the WebTransport
object.

## Performance

### Speculation rules: mobile `eager` eagerness improvements

On mobile, `eager` eagerness speculation rules prefetches and prerenders now
trigger when HTML anchor elements are in the viewport for a short time.

offer or answer does not permute the header extensions negotiated unless the user
wants that to happen.

## Isolated Web Apps

### Web Smart Card API for Isolated Web Apps

Available on Isolated Web Apps (IWA) only. Enables smart card (PC/SC) applications to move to the Web platform. It gives
them access to the PC/SC implementation (and card reader drivers) available in
the host OS.

Administrators can control the availability of this API either:

- Globally—using the `DefaultSmartCardConnectSetting` policy.
- Per-application—using the `SmartCardConnectAllowedForUrls` and
  `SmartCardConnectBlockedForUrls` policies.

## Origin trials

### Digital Credentials API (issuance support)

This feature lets issuing websites (for example, a university,
government agency, or bank) to securely initiate the provisioning (issuance)
process of digital credentials directly into a user's mobile wallet application.
On Android, this capability uses the Android `IdentityCredential` CredMan
system (Credential Manager). On Desktop, it uses cross-device approaches
using the CTAP protocol similar to Digital Credentials presentation.

## Deprecations and removals

## Deprecate XSLT

XSLT v1.0, which all browsers adhere to, was standardized in 1999. In the meantime, XSLT has evolved to v2.0 and v3.0, adding features, and growing apart from the version frozen into browsers. This lack of advancement, coupled with the rise of JavaScript libraries and frameworks that offer more flexible and powerful DOM manipulation, has led to a significant decline in the use of client-side XSLT. Its role within the web browser has been largely superseded by JavaScript-based technologies, such as JSON and React.

Chromium uses the libxslt library to process these transformations, and libxslt was unmaintained for around 6 months of 2025. Libxslt is a complex, aging C codebase of the type notoriously susceptible to memory safety vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Because client-side XSLT is now a niche, rarely-used feature, these libraries receive far less maintenance and security scrutiny than core JavaScript engines, yet they represent a direct, potent attack surface for processing untrusted web content. Indeed, XSLT is the source of several recent high-profile security exploits that continue to put browser users at risk. For these reasons, Chromium (along with both other browser engines) plans to deprecate and remove XSLT from the web platform. For more details, see [Removing XSLT for a more secure browser](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/deprecating-xslt).

### Deprecate getters of Intl Locale Info

Intl Locale Info API is a Stage 3 ECMAScript TC39 proposal to enhance the
Intl.Locale object by exposing Locale information, such as week data (first day
in a week, weekend start day, weekend end day, minimum day in the first week),
and text direction hour cycle used in the locale.

Changes in Stage 3 of the specification moves several getters to functions.
These are now being updated in Chrome to match the specification.

### FedCM Privacy Enforcement for Client Metadata

To address cross-site identity correlation risks in the FedCM API, Identity
Providers (IdPs) that use client\_metadata within their FedCM configuration
are required to implement the direct endpoints format in the
`.well-known/web-identity` file. This mandate ensures that both accounts\_endpoint
and login\_url are explicitly defined whenever a client\_metadata\_endpoint is
present. This approach strengthens privacy protections by preventing relying
parties from exploiting metadata to correlate user identities across multiple
sites.

In Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): If client\_metadata\_endpoint exists but
accounts\_endpoint or login\_url is missing, the browser will display console
warnings. This gives IdPs time to update configurations.

### FedCM-Migration of nonce to params field and renaming of `IdentityCredentialError` `code` attribute to `error`

Migration of nonce to params field: The nonce parameter in
navigator.credentials.get() is moving from a top-level field to the params
object for better API design, extensibility, and maintainability. This
structured approach simplifies parsing for Identity Providers, supports
future-proofing without versioning, and aligns with modern API patterns. For
Relying Parties, the impact is minimal—they provide the same nonce value in a
new location.

In Chrome 143 (Warning Phase): nonce accepted both at top level
and inside params. Top-level usage triggers a console warning.

Rename code to error in `IdentityCredentialError`: The `code` attribute in
`IdentityCredentialError` is renamed to `error` for clearer semantics, better
developer experience, and alignment with web standards. This change reduces
ambiguity and avoids conflicts with `DOMException.code`. Additionally, `error.code`
becomes `error.error`, retaining its DOMString type.

In Chrome 143 (Warning
Phase): Both `error` and `code` attributes are supported. Using `code` triggers a
console warning, guiding developers to migrate.
