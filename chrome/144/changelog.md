## CSS and UI

### CSS find-in-page highlight pseudos

This feature exposes *find-in-page* search result styling to authors as a
highlight pseudo-element, similar to selection and spelling errors. This lets
developers change foreground and background colors or add text decorations. This
is especially useful if browser defaults have insufficient contrast with page
colors or are otherwise unsuitable.

### Non-tree-scoped container-name matching

Ignore tree-scope when matching `container-name` for `@container` queries.

Previously, `container-name` matching for container queries used tree-scoped
names or references for matching. This meant the same name didn't match if the
`@container` rule and the `container-type` property originated from different
trees, such that the `container-type` declaration came from an inner shadow
tree.

With this change, container names match regardless of `@container` rule or
`container-type` declaration origins.

### CSS anchor positioning with transforms

When an anchor-positioned element is tethered against an anchor that has a
transform (or is contained by an element with a transform), resolve `anchor()`
and `anchor-size()` functions against the bounding box of the transformed
anchor.

### CSS `caret-shape` property

The caret's shape in native applications is most commonly a vertical bar, an
underscore, or a rectangular block. Additionally, the shape often varies
depending on the input mode, for example, insert or replace. The CSS
`caret-shape` property lets sites choose one of these shapes for the caret
inside editable elements, or leave the choice to the browser. The recognized
property values are `auto`, `bar`, `block`, and `underscore`.

### SVG2 CSS cascading

Align the Chrome implementation with the SVG2 specification for matching CSS
rules in `<use>` element trees.

Match selectors against the `<use>` instantiation elements instead of the
originating element subtree. This means selectors no longer match ancestor and
sibling elements outside the cloned subtree. More importantly, state selectors,
for example, `:hover`, now start matching in `<use>` instances.

### Respect `overscroll-behavior` on non-scrollable scroll containers

The `overscroll-behavior` property applies to all scroll container elements,
regardless of whether those elements currently have overflowing content or are
user scrollable. Developers can use `overscroll-behavior` to prevent scroll
propagation on an `overflow: hidden` backdrop or an `overflow: auto` element
without considering whether it will currently be overflowing.

|
[Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overscroll-1/#propdef-overscroll-behavior)

### Respect `overscroll-behavior` for keyboard scrolls

When you set `overscroll-behavior` to a value other than `auto`, the browser
shouldn't perform scroll chaining. The browser respects this for mouse or touch
scrolling, but keyboard scrolls ignored it. This change makes keyboard scrolling
also respect `overscroll-behavior`.

### Side-relative syntax for `background-position-x/y` longhands

Defines the background image position relative to one of its edges.

This syntax gives developers more flexible and responsive mechanisms to define
the background image position, instead of using fixed values that need
adaptation to the window or frame size.

This feature also applies to the `-webkit-mask-position` property to ensure web
compatibility.

### View transitions `waitUntil()` method

View transitions automatically construct a pseudo-element tree to display and
animate participating elements in the transition. Per the specification, this
subtree is constructed when the view transition starts animating and is
destroyed when the animations associated with all view transition
pseudo-elements are in the finished state (or more precisely, in a non-running,
non-paused state).

This works for most cases and provides a seamless experience for developers.
However, for more advanced cases, this is insufficient because developers
sometimes want the view transition pseudo-tree to persist beyond the animation
finish state.

One example is tying view transitions with Scroll Driven Animations. When a
scroll timeline controls the animation, the subtree shouldn't be destroyed when
the animations finish because scrolling back should still animate the pseudo
elements.

To enable advanced uses of view transition, this intent adds a `waitUntil()`
function on the `ViewTransition` object that takes a promise. This promise
delays destruction of the pseudo-tree until it settles.

## Device

### `XRVisibilityMaskChange`

Adds an `XRVisibilityMaskChange` event that provides a list of vertices and a
list of indices to represent the mesh of the visible portion of the user's
viewport. This data can then limit the amount of the viewport drawn to, which
improves performance. To better support this event, `XRView` objects are also
given unique identifiers to allow easier pairing with the associated masks. This
extends the core WebXR specification.

## DOM

### The `<geolocation>` element

Introduces the `<geolocation>` element, a declarative, user-activated control
for accessing the user's location. It streamlines the user and developer journey
by handling the permission flow and directly providing location data to the
site. This often eliminates the need for a separate JavaScript API call.

This addresses the long-standing problem of permission prompts triggering
directly from JavaScript without a strong signal of user intent. By embedding a
browser-controlled element in the page, the user's click provides a clear,
intentional signal. This enables a better prompt UX and, crucially, provides a
recovery path for users who previously denied the permission.

**Note:** This feature was previously developed and tested in an origin trial as the
more generic `<permission>` element. Based on feedback from developers and other
browser vendors, it evolved into the capability-specific `<geolocation>` element
to provide a more tailored and powerful developer experience.

alignment on array elements or to pad nested structure offsets to a multiple of
16 bytes.

### Temporal in ECMA262

The Temporal API in ECMA262 is a new API that provides standard objects and
functions for working with dates and times. `Date` has been a long-standing pain
point in ECMAScript. This proposes `Temporal`, a global `Object` that acts as a
top-level namespace (similar to `Math`), which brings a modern date and time API
to the ECMAScript language.

### Mirroring of RTL MathML operators

Supports character-level and glyph-level mirroring when rendering MathML
operators in right-to-left mode.

When using RTL mode, some operators can be mirrored by changing them to another
code point. For example, a right parenthesis becomes a left parenthesis. This is
character-level mirroring, with equivalences defined by Unicode's
`Bidi_Mirrored` property.

Some operators have no appropriate mirroring character. Glyph-level mirroring
applies in this case, with the `rtlm` font feature, where another glyph can
replace it in a mirrored context. Some existing implementations mirror the
original glyph directly, but this might change the meaning for asymmetrical
characters, for example, the clockwise contour integral.

### The `clipboardchange` event

The `clipboardchange` event fires whenever a web app or any other system
application changes the system clipboard contents. This lets web apps, for
example, remote desktop clients, keep their clipboards synchronized with the
system clipboard. It provides an efficient alternative to polling the clipboard
(using JavaScript) for changes.

## Permissions

### User-Agent Client Hints `ch-ua-high-entropy-values` permissions policy

Adds support for a `ch-ua-high-entropy-values` permissions policy that enables a
top-level site to restrict which documents can collect high-entropy client hints
with the `navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues()` JavaScript API.

Restricting collection of high-entropy hints over HTTP is possible through
existing per-client-hint permissions policies.

## Performance

### Performance and Event Timing: `interactionCount`

The Event Timing API is part of the Performance Timeline and measures the
performance of user interactions. Certain events have an `interactionId` value
assigned to them. This is useful for grouping related interactions based on
common physical user inputs or gestures.

This feature adds a `performance.interactionCount` property, which is the total
number of interactions that occurred on the page.

In particular, this feature is useful for computing the Interaction to Next
Paint (INP) metric value. This requires knowing the total number of interactions
to compute a high percentile score (p98 for pages with more than 50 total
interactions).

This feature has been specified for a long time, was prototyped in Chromium a
long time ago but never shipped, is part of Interop 2025, and is available in
other browsers.

**Note:** A more powerful `performance.eventCounts` map for specific events exists,
but you can't accurately map event counts to interaction counts.

## User input

### Interoperable pointer and mouse boundary events after DOM changes

After an event target is removed from the DOM, the logical target of the
pointer, as implied by the Pointer and Mouse boundary events (that is, `over`,
`out`, `enter`, and `leave` events), should be the nearest ancestor still
attached to the DOM.

The PEWG recently reached consensus on this behavior.

Chrome tracked a node even after it was removed from the DOM. As a result, if
the pointer moves to a new node B after the hit-test node A is removed from the
DOM, the boundary event sequence (`pointerover`, `pointerout`, `pointerenter`,
`pointerleave` events, and the corresponding mouse events) implied a pointer
movement from A to B. As per the new consensus, the event sequence implies a
pointer movement from the "parent of A" to B.

## WebRTC

### `RTCDegradationPreference` enum value `maintain-framerate-and-resolution`

`maintain-framerate-and-resolution` disables WebRTC's internal video adaptation.
This lets the application implement its own adaptation logic and prevents
interference from the internal adaptation.

From the WebRTC MediaStreamTrack Content Hints specification:

Maintain framerate and resolution regardless of video quality. The user agent
shouldn't prefer reducing the framerate or resolution for quality and
performance reasons, but might drop frames before encoding if necessary not to
overuse network and encoder resources.

## Isolated Web Apps (IWA)

receive User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets from them, and specify additional
parameters when sending UDP packets to multicast addresses.

## Origin trials

### Enhanced Canvas API `TextMetrics`

Expands the `TextMetrics` Canvas API to support selection rectangles, bounding
box queries, and glyph cluster-based operations.

This new functionality enables complex text editing applications with accurate
selection, caret positioning, and hit testing. Additionally, cluster-based
rendering facilitates sophisticated text effects, for example, independent
character animations and styling.

### Context-aware media elements

Context-aware media elements, are a declarative, user-activated control for
accessing the starting and interacting with media streams.

This addresses the long-standing problem of permission prompts being triggered
directly from JavaScript without a strong signal of user intent. By embedding a
browser-controlled element in the page, the user's click provides a clear,
intentional signal. This enables a much better prompt UX and, crucially,
provides a recovery path for users who have previously denied the permission.

**Note:** This feature was previously developed and tested in an Origin Trial as the
more generic `<permission>` element. Based on feedback from developers and other
browser vendors, it has evolved into capability-specific elements to provide a
more tailored and powerful developer experience.

## Deprecations and removals

### Deprecate and remove: Private Aggregation API

The Private Aggregation API is a generic mechanism for measuring aggregate,
cross-site data in a privacy-preserving manner. It was originally designed for a
future without third-party cookies.

Following Chrome's announcement that the current approach to third-party cookies
will be maintained, Chrome plans to deprecate and remove the Private Aggregation
API (along with certain other Privacy Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy
Sandbox feature status page). This API is only exposed through the Shared
Storage and Protected Audience APIs, which are also planned for deprecation and
removal. Therefore, no additional work is required for Private Aggregation.

### Deprecate and Remove: Shared Storage API

The Shared Storage API is a privacy-preserving web API that enables storage not
partitioned by a first-party site.

Following Chrome's announcement that the current approach to third-party cookies
will be maintained, Chrome plans to deprecate and remove the Shared Storage API
(along with certain other Privacy Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy

### Externally loaded entities in XML parsing

Chrome synchronously fetches external XML entities or DTDs and incorporates them
into parsing under specific circumstances. This document proposes removing this
functionality.

For example, `http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml`
shows how external entities can be defined in the trailing part of the `DOCTYPE`
statement. These entities then refer to resources that are synchronously loaded
and included as context when parsing XML.

Another syntax example is a `DOCTYPE` that, using the `SYSTEM` keyword followed
by a URL, points to a DTD that contains additional entity definitions.

The parser passes up such external load requests.

According to the XML specification, non-validating processors are not required
to read external entities.

Chrome plans to deprecate loading external entity definitions in XML documents
that don't use XSLT.
