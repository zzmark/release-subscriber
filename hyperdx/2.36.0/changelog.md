## @hyperdx/app@2.36.0

### Minor Changes

- fb284465: Alert forms for saved searches and dashboard tiles can now send to several webhooks. Add or remove notification channels inline (up to 10); webhooks already chosen by the alert are greyed out in the other pickers, since duplicates are rejected.
- b1d8dc14: Formulas now work on log and trace sources, not just metrics. Time series, table and number charts on event sources can define derived series via letter-ref arithmetic expressions (e.g. `A / B * 100`), with the same editor controls (Add Formula, series letter badges, Show input series) previously offered only on metric sources. Event formulas compile inline into the chart's single-scan SELECT — no per-series query fan-out — with the same missing-data semantics as the existing events ratio toggle.
- e153f46d: Add metric formula editing to the chart editor. Metric-source charts (time series, table, number) gain an "Add Formula" row: a letter-ref arithmetic expression over the chart's series (`A` = series 1, `B` = series 2, ...) such as `A / (A + B) * 100`, with inline structured validation (malformed expressions, unknown series references), per-formula alias and number format, and a "Show input series" toggle to render only the formula column(s) or the formula alongside its operand series. Series rows now carry their reference letter as a badge. Formulas and the "As Ratio" toggle are mutually exclusive, and formulas persist on dashboard tiles and standalone charts.

### Patch Changes

- 59b96e99: Upgrade the session replay player from `rrweb@2.0.0-alpha.8` to stable `rrweb@2.1.1`, aligning the replayer with the rrweb version used by current `@hyperdx/browser` recorders and picking up several years of upstream replayer fixes (style-sheet handling, virtual DOM, adopted stylesheets). Replay fidelity was verified for sessions recorded with both `rrweb@1.1.3` (older browser SDKs) and `rrweb@2.1.1` (current SDKs).
- f31a1458: Make the `CopySnippet` heading optional (omit `label` to hide it) and add
  `IconAiNotebook`, a Tabler-compatible custom icon for AI notebooks.
- 68d2ed20: feat: Support dependent variable value queries
- 2eedfb26: feat: Substitute dashboard variables in chart builder tiles
- 1ce61c0c: feat: Expand dashboard variables and macros nested in macro arguments
- 43f68566: Allow editing and deleting alerts directly from the alert details page. An
  "Edit alert" action opens a modal for changing the alert's threshold,
  evaluation interval, schedule, group-by (saved-search alerts), notification
  webhook, and note, and a Delete action (with confirmation) removes the alert
  and returns to the alerts list. Alert API responses now include the
  notification channel's webhook id and the alert's name/message template so
  edits round-trip these fields.
- 905d1941: Adopt React 19 context and ref APIs across the app and enforce them via ESLint.
  Render `<Context>` directly instead of `<Context.Provider>`, use the `use` hook
  instead of `useContext`, and pass `ref` as a regular prop instead of wrapping
  components in `forwardRef`. The corresponding `@eslint-react/no-context-provider`,
  `no-use-context`, and `no-forward-ref` rules are promoted to `error` and the
  app's `--max-warnings` ceiling is lowered. Behavior is unchanged.
- b0b13806: Align alert firing/recovery chart markers with the evaluated data: markers are now drawn at the start of the newest evaluated bucket (matching the evaluation history table and the plotted data point) instead of at the evaluation time, which sat one bucket to the right.
- 8be68100: Fix dashboard filter selection state breaking on complex expressions. The
  filter parser (shared with the search page) now tracks parenthesis depth in
  addition to quote depth, so selections stored for expression-based filters such
  as `if(SeverityText = 'error' OR SeverityText = 'fatal', 'Errors', 'Non-errors')`
  or `if(SeverityText IN ('error', 'fatal'), 'Errors', 'Non-errors')` are parsed
  correctly instead of being dropped or split on operators/keywords nested inside
  the expression.
- 9c7742fa: Fix multi-series metric charts mixing float and integer aggregations (e.g. histogram quantile + histogram count) failing with "No value columns found in result column metadata". The composed UNION ALL query now normalizes every series value to Float64, so the merged column type is deterministic instead of erroring with NO_COMMON_TYPE or producing a Variant(Float64, Int64) column depending on the ClickHouse server's `use_variant_as_common_type` setting. As a defensive layer, all-numeric `Variant(...)` result columns (e.g. from raw-SQL charts) are now also classified as numeric.
- 75909ace: Fix Surrounding Context filters for non-OTEL schemas by using the source's serviceNameExpression for the "Service" filter instead of hardcoded ResourceAttributes lookup. Also adds quick event attribute filters that let users toggle attributes from the current event to narrow surrounding context results.
- 7294944a: fix: route per-query SQL debug logging through an injectable logger (#2416)

  `BaseClickhouseClient` dumped raw SQL to the console on every ClickHouse query,
  unconditionally and outside the pino logger, flooding API logs with query spam.

  Query logging now goes through an optional per-client `customLogger` on
  `ClickhouseClientOptions`, logged at `debug`, and is silent when no logger is
  passed. The API injects a pino-backed logger, so query logging follows the
  existing `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL` setting instead of writing to `console.debug`. The
  browser client defaults to a console logger that pretty-prints the SQL as a
  single multi-line block, so query SQL stays visible and readable in devtools in
  all builds instead of wrapping into one long line.

  The API's log level now defaults to `info` (was `debug`), so SQL logging is
  silent in production unless `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL=debug` is set. Dev and CI env
  files already pin their levels explicitly and are unaffected. The default also
  now applies when `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL` is set but empty — which is what Compose
  passes when the variable is unset in the environment, and which previously made
  pino throw at startup.

- 47fe0cd9: Use the categorical chart palette and shared tooltip on histogram charts (including Request Latency on the Services dashboard) instead of a hardcoded neon green fill and a one-off tooltip.
- 9f640a61: Add a Rotate action for the personal API access key in Team Settings → API & Agents. Previously the personal access key — the bearer token for the external API v2 and the MCP server — was generated once at account creation and could never be changed, so a leaked key could only be remediated by deleting the user. Rotating immediately revokes the previous key, so MCP / AI agent configs, external API v2 clients, Terraform / IaC providers, and CI scripts using the old key must be updated with the new one. Browser sessions are unaffected.
- c4dcab95: Introduce a shared `ChartCard` component that gives standalone charts the same
  card treatment as custom dashboard tiles (bordered surface + full-bleed header
  divider). The card header stays pinned while the card body scrolls (e.g. cards
  wrapping a long list like "Top 20 Most Time Consuming Queries"): in card mode
  the header is a fixed row and scrollable list content gets its own internal
  scroll region, so the header no longer scrolls away once you pass the first
  card-height of content. Migrate the Service
  Dashboards (HTTP, Database, Errors, endpoint and DB-query side panels) and the
  ClickHouse page from the old `ChartBox` wrapper to `ChartCard` so chart surfaces
  look consistent across the app.

## @hyperdx/otel-collector@2.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 395ae8d6: feat: support per-signal ClickHouse table TTLs and reconcile TTL on existing tables

  Adds `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_LOGS_TTL`, `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_TRACES_TTL`, `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_METRICS_TTL` and `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_SESSIONS_TTL`, each falling back to the existing `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_TABLES_TTL`, so retention can be configured independently per signal (e.g. keep logs and traces for 6 months while metrics stay at 30 days).

  When `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_RECONCILE_TABLE_TTL=true`, the migrate tool also applies the configured TTL to tables that already exist (`ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY TTL`), diff-guarded so only tables whose retention actually differs are changed. Previously a changed TTL only affected newly-created tables. Extending a retention uses `materialize_ttl_after_modify=1` so data already on disk is kept for the new (longer) period; shrinking uses `=0` so a startup reconcile never triggers a bulk delete (existing parts age out under their old TTL). Only a plain `<anchor> + <one fixed-length interval>` retention is rewritten: compound policies (`TO VOLUME`/`TO DISK` tiering, `RECOMPRESS`, `GROUP BY` rollups, several rules) and calendar-unit retentions (month/quarter/year) are reported and left untouched. Off by default. Implements hyperdxio/hyperdx#1311.

### Patch Changes

- d205a776: Allow the ClickHouse exporter request timeout to be configured with
  `HYPERDX_OTEL_EXPORTER_TIMEOUT` in both OpAMP-managed and standalone collector
  modes. The default remains 5 seconds.

## @hyperdx/common-utils@0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- be26530f: Add plural alert notification channel schemas: `zAlertChannels` (1–10 entries), `MAX_ALERT_CHANNELS`, and a shared `channel`/`channels` cross-field validator, ahead of multi-channel alert support in the API.
- b1d8dc14: Formulas now work on log and trace sources, not just metrics. Time series, table and number charts on event sources can define derived series via letter-ref arithmetic expressions (e.g. `A / B * 100`), with the same editor controls (Add Formula, series letter badges, Show input series) previously offered only on metric sources. Event formulas compile inline into the chart's single-scan SELECT — no per-series query fan-out — with the same missing-data semantics as the existing events ratio toggle.
- dc29d57f: Chart formulas are now supported across every API surface that persists or accepts chart configs. The external dashboards API v2 and the MCP `save_dashboard` / `patch_dashboard` tools accept `formulas` (letter-ref arithmetic over the tile's select items, e.g. `A / (A + B) * 100`) and `showOperandSeries` on line, stacked bar, table and number builder tiles, round-trip them through GET/PUT, and validate the expressions on write — unknown series refs, malformed syntax, combining formulas with `asRatio`, multiple formulas on a number tile, and formulas on formula-incapable source kinds (anything other than metric, log, or trace) are all rejected with actionable errors. MCP `query_tile` computes formula columns for both metric and log/trace event tiles, the query-guide prompt documents the feature, and the OpenAPI spec includes the new `Formula` schema. The CLI's dashboard tile pipeline now delegates its number/table config transforms to the shared common-utils implementations, so formula tiles render with operand-hiding behavior identical to the web.
- 3ecf73c2: Render metric formulas (`formulas` on builder chart configs) in the composed multi-series metric query. Letter-ref expressions like `A / (A + B + C) * 100` compile into the final SELECT projection over the pivoted per-series columns, with ratio-consistent missing-data semantics: a missing operand counts as 0 while a zero or missing division denominator yields NULL (a rendered gap). `showOperandSeries: false` emits only the formula column(s). Works for grouped and ungrouped line, table, and number charts, and single-series charts with a formula now route through the composed query path.
- 3ecf73c2: "Convert to SQL" now supports multi-series, ratio, and formula metric charts. The composed UNION ALL + pivot query is emitted as a macro-based raw-SQL template with a `$__sourceTable(<metricType>)` macro per series branch, instead of returning a "cannot be auto-converted" error. Non-time-series metric charts remain unsupported, matching the existing single-series restriction.

### Patch Changes

- c349a5dd: HAVING, ORDER BY and LIMIT on multi-series metric charts now apply to the final joined result instead of leaking into each per-series branch. They reference the chart's output columns — operand aliases, formula names/aliases, the ratio column, group-by columns and the time bucket — so a HAVING like `"err rate" > 0.5` filters the joined rows, ORDER BY actually orders the result (previously it was applied per branch and then discarded by the join), and LIMIT/OFFSET paginate one consistent group set across all series.
- 68d2ed20: feat: Support dependent variable value queries
- 2eedfb26: feat: Substitute dashboard variables in chart builder tiles
- 1ce61c0c: feat: Expand dashboard variables and macros nested in macro arguments
- 43f68566: Allow editing and deleting alerts directly from the alert details page. An
  "Edit alert" action opens a modal for changing the alert's threshold,
  evaluation interval, schedule, group-by (saved-search alerts), notification
  webhook, and note, and a Delete action (with confirmation) removes the alert
  and returns to the alerts list. Alert API responses now include the
  notification channel's webhook id and the alert's name/message template so
  edits round-trip these fields.
- 40ec0858: feat: Add dashboard variable properties to external dashboards API
- b0b13806: Align alert firing/recovery chart markers with the evaluated data: markers are now drawn at the start of the newest evaluated bucket (matching the evaluation history table and the plotted data point) instead of at the evaluation time, which sat one bucket to the right.
- a94d6da8: Fix filter sidebar values disappearing behind query proxies. Batched facet-value
  queries (KV rollup and map text-index lookups) previously bound one query
  parameter per key; with ~100 keys this exceeded the ClickHouse web client's URL
  parameter budget, silently promoting the request to a multipart/form-data body
  that proxy gateways can reject — every LowCardinality-column and map-attribute
  filter then vanished without an error. Keys are now inlined as SQL-escaped
  literals so the query rides the POST body with a constant parameter count. Also
  fixes an operator-precedence bug that applied the KV rollup time filter (and
  notEmpty guard) to only the last OR branch.
- 8be68100: Fix dashboard filter selection state breaking on complex expressions. The
  filter parser (shared with the search page) now tracks parenthesis depth in
  addition to quote depth, so selections stored for expression-based filters such
  as `if(SeverityText = 'error' OR SeverityText = 'fatal', 'Errors', 'Non-errors')`
  or `if(SeverityText IN ('error', 'fatal'), 'Errors', 'Non-errors')` are parsed
  correctly instead of being dropped or split on operators/keywords nested inside
  the expression.
- c592207b: Fix MCP tool schemas being rejected by strict JSON Schema draft 2020-12 clients. The number-tile `colorRules` `between` rule declared its `value` as a Zod tuple, which `zod-to-json-schema` renders in the draft-07 tuple form (`items: [ ... ]`). Draft 2020-12 requires `items` to be a schema rather than an array, so `clickstack_save_dashboard` and `clickstack_patch_dashboard` failed validation — and clients that forward MCP tool schemas straight to an LLM provider (e.g. the Anthropic API) rejected the entire tool list with `tools.N.custom.input_schema: JSON schema is invalid`, making the MCP server unusable. `value` is now a fixed-length array, which validates identically and serializes to the same `[min, max]` wire format. A new test validates every MCP tool's input schema against the 2020-12 metaschema so this cannot regress.
- 9c7742fa: Fix multi-series metric charts mixing float and integer aggregations (e.g. histogram quantile + histogram count) failing with "No value columns found in result column metadata". The composed UNION ALL query now normalizes every series value to Float64, so the merged column type is deterministic instead of erroring with NO_COMMON_TYPE or producing a Variant(Float64, Int64) column depending on the ClickHouse server's `use_variant_as_common_type` setting. As a defensive layer, all-numeric `Variant(...)` result columns (e.g. from raw-SQL charts) are now also classified as numeric.
- 7294944a: fix: route per-query SQL debug logging through an injectable logger (#2416)

  `BaseClickhouseClient` dumped raw SQL to the console on every ClickHouse query,
  unconditionally and outside the pino logger, flooding API logs with query spam.

  Query logging now goes through an optional per-client `customLogger` on
  `ClickhouseClientOptions`, logged at `debug`, and is silent when no logger is
  passed. The API injects a pino-backed logger, so query logging follows the
  existing `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL` setting instead of writing to `console.debug`. The
  browser client defaults to a console logger that pretty-prints the SQL as a
  single multi-line block, so query SQL stays visible and readable in devtools in
  all builds instead of wrapping into one long line.

  The API's log level now defaults to `info` (was `debug`), so SQL logging is
  silent in production unless `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL=debug` is set. Dev and CI env
  files already pin their levels explicitly and are unaffected. The default also
  now applies when `HYPERDX_LOG_LEVEL` is set but empty — which is what Compose
  passes when the variable is unset in the environment, and which previously made
  pino throw at startup.

- e153f46d: Number charts on metric formula configs always hide their operand series: `convertToNumberChartConfig` forces `showOperandSeries: false` when formulas are present, so the number tile renders the formula column rather than the first raw operand — regardless of the tile's "Show input series" setting on other display types or when a formula chart is switched to the Number display type.
- 9f640a61: Add a Rotate action for the personal API access key in Team Settings → API & Agents. Previously the personal access key — the bearer token for the external API v2 and the MCP server — was generated once at account creation and could never be changed, so a leaked key could only be remediated by deleting the user. Rotating immediately revokes the previous key, so MCP / AI agent configs, external API v2 clients, Terraform / IaC providers, and CI scripts using the old key must be updated with the new one. Browser sessions are unaffected.
- ea127077: Apply the Map KV text-index rewrite (`Map['k'] = 'v'` → `has(ItemsCol, concat('k', '=', 'v'))`, enabling ClickHouse's direct-read optimization) to SQL predicates in the top-level `where` (search box, saved searches, alerts) and to SQL `aggCondition`s copied into the WHERE clause — previously only `sql`-type `filters[]` entries were rewritten

## @hyperdx/api@2.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 8723d7af: Alerts can be configured with multiple notification channels (up to 10 webhooks) via the new `channels` field on the v2 external API, internal API, and the MCP `clickstack_save_alert` tool. The legacy singular `channel` field is still accepted on input and mirrored in responses, so existing integrations keep working unchanged.

  Note that alert updates are a full replace, not a merge. A client that sends only the legacy `channel` field when updating an alert that has several channels will reduce it to that one channel — fetch the alert and resend the complete `channels` array to preserve them.

- a4b2ad00: The API now recovers from a MongoDB that is unreachable at startup, and exposes a Mongo-aware readiness endpoint. Previously a failed initial connect was never retried: the process kept listening while every Mongo-backed request timed out, `/health` reported 200, and Kubernetes kept the pod Ready indefinitely — cascading into OpAMP 500s and crash-looping collectors. The initial connection is now retried with capped exponential backoff until it succeeds, and both the API and OpAMP servers expose `GET /ready`, which returns 503 unless MongoDB is connected (point Kubernetes readiness probes at it; `/health` remains a pure liveness check).
- dc29d57f: Chart formulas are now supported across every API surface that persists or accepts chart configs. The external dashboards API v2 and the MCP `save_dashboard` / `patch_dashboard` tools accept `formulas` (letter-ref arithmetic over the tile's select items, e.g. `A / (A + B) * 100`) and `showOperandSeries` on line, stacked bar, table and number builder tiles, round-trip them through GET/PUT, and validate the expressions on write — unknown series refs, malformed syntax, combining formulas with `asRatio`, multiple formulas on a number tile, and formulas on formula-incapable source kinds (anything other than metric, log, or trace) are all rejected with actionable errors. MCP `query_tile` computes formula columns for both metric and log/trace event tiles, the query-guide prompt documents the feature, and the OpenAPI spec includes the new `Formula` schema. The CLI's dashboard tile pipeline now delegates its number/table config transforms to the shared common-utils implementations, so formula tiles render with operand-hiding behavior identical to the web.

A new test validates every MCP tool's input schema against the 2020-12 metaschema so this cannot regress.
- e153f46d: Tile alerts on metric charts with formulas now evaluate the formula value instead of the last raw operand series: the alert task previously dropped `formulas`/`showOperandSeries` when rebuilding the tile's chart config, so an alert on a formula tile compared the threshold against a raw operand (e.g. bytes) rather than the derived value. Grouped ratio tile alerts also now honor `ratioMode` (`share_of_total` previously evaluated as `per_group`).
- 7294944a: fix: route per-query SQL debug logging through an injectable logger (#2416)

  `BaseClickhouseClient` dumped raw SQL to the console on every ClickHouse query,

- e60a7d30: fix: populate the span StatusMessage on failed MCP tool calls so the error text is visible in the trace
- 9f640a61: Add a Rotate action for the personal API access key in Team Settings → API & Agents.

Browser sessions are unaffected.
- 08e5b62f: Stop the external dashboards API returning aggregation parameters the aggregation cannot carry: a `level` left over from a quantile agg, or a `valueExpression` left over on a count. Both are ignored when rendering, but the input schema rejects them, so a GET body could not be PUT back and importing a dashboard into Terraform failed with "Level can only be used with quantile aggregation function".
